    "text": "Niger, a landlocked country in Africa’s Sahel region, faces rising temperatures, low rainfall and a decrease of arable land, indicative of desertification. The shrinking land and water sources pose food and water security threats, risking humanitarian crises and conflicts. Initiatives like Action Against Desertification (FAO-UN) and regional projects (FLEUVE, BRICKS) aim to restore degraded land and push back the desert. Most major initiatives in the fight against desertification converge on the flagship project “Great Green Wall,” spanning 15km wide and 8000km long, targeting 100 million hectares of degraded land restoration, carbon sequestration, and green job creation by 2030.\nHowever, as each task force operates independently, there is a lack of centralized visibility on desertification risks in the nation to mobilise the GGW action plan with urgency and prioritise resources systematically across diverse actors.\n\n\n\nThis application is meant for the local government, NGOs and the different organisations involved in the Great Green Wall initiative so that there is a centralized platform where they can visualise to what extent desertification affects Niger people at high spatial resolution.\nFuture extensions of the tool include highlighting specific areas within the designated Great Green Wall path that are most suitable for planting trees and soil-enriching crops, making the insights more actionable for the implementing task forces and farmers nationwide.\n\n\n\nTo derive the Desertification Index (detailed methodology below), we will be using:\n\nLandsat 8 data for hyperspectral remote sensing data\nMODIS data for climate and rainfall data\n\nFurthermore, we need population density data, which can obtained as rasters from WorldPop.\nFinally, to delineate the boundaries of interest, we will utilize the following vector files:\n\nGreat Green Wall designated area, traced according to the Niger government’s Action Plan.\nNiger Administrative Boundaries, Level 0 through 4 from GADM\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Wu et al. (2019), the Desertification Index is calculated using Landsat 8 and MODIS remote sensing data within the feature space of Albedo and Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI). More specifically, the Desertification Monitoring Index (DMI) is defined as:\n\\[ \\Large DMI = L_2 = \\frac{|{Albedo - \\alpha MSAVI - \\beta|}}{\\sqrt{1+\\alpha^2}} \\]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe larger \\(L_2\\) , the more degraded the soil is. The distance \\(L_2\\) represents the distance of the tassel from the soil line \\(L\\) , derived from the respective indices are calculated as follows:\n\\[ Albedo = 0.356B_{blue} + 0.13B_{red} + 0.373B_{nir} + 0.085B_{swir1} + 0.072B_{swir2} - 0.0018 \\]\n\\[ MSAVI = \\frac{2B_{nir} + 1 - \\sqrt{(2B_{nir} + 1)^2 - 8(B_{nir}-B_{red})}}2 \\]\nLastly, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are the parameters of the regression equation for the soil line \\(L\\) in the feature space.\n\\[ Albedo = \\alpha MSAVI + \\beta  \\]\nIt is worth noting that this methodology has shown high accuracy in detecting and classifying desertification only in the Naiman Banner in Inner Mongolia (China) and not specifically in the Southern Sahel where Niger is located.
