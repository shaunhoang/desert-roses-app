    "text": "Project Summary\n\nProblem Statement\nNiger, a landlocked country in Africa’s Sahel region, faces rising temperatures, low rainfall and a decrease in arable land, indicative of desertification. The shrinking land and water sources pose food and water security threats, risking humanitarian crises and conflicts. Initiatives like Action Against Desertification (FAO-UN) and regional projects (FLEUVE, BRICKS) aim to restore degraded land and push back the desert.\nHowever, as each task force operates independently, there is a lack of centralized visibility on desertification risks in the nation to mobilise the GGW action plan with urgency and prioritise resources systematically across diverse actors.\n\n\nEnd User\nThis application is meant for the local government, NGOs and the different organisations involved in the Great Green Wall initiative so that there is a centralized platform where they can visualise to what extent desertification affects Niger people at high spatial resolution.\nFuture extensions of the tool include highlighting specific areas within the designated Great Green Wall path that are most suitable for planting trees and soil-enriching crops, making the insights more actionable for the implementing task forces and farmers nationwide.\n\n\nData Source\nTo derive the Desertification Index (detailed methodology below), we used Landsat 8 data (2013-present) for hyperspectral remote sensing data containing all the necessary spectral bands. Furthermore, to quantify the affected population, we used the WorldPop global population raster data at 100m resolution (2000-2020). Finally, to delineate the boundaries of interest, we will utilise Niger Administrative Boundaries, Level 0 through 2.\n\n\nMethodology\nAccording to Wu et al. (2019), the Desertification Risk Index (DRI) can be calculated using Landsat 8 remote sensing data, from which Albedo and Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) were calculated.\n\\[ Albedo = 0.356B_{blue} + 0.13B_{red} + 0.373B_{nir} + 0.085B_{swir1} + 0.072B_{swir2} - 0.0018 \\]\n\\[ MSAVI = \\frac{2B_{nir} + 1 - \\sqrt{(2B_{nir} + 1)^2 - 8(B_{nir}-B_{red})}}2 \\]\nThe Desertification Risk Index (DRI) is then defined as:\n\\[ DRI = L_1 = \\sqrt{(MSAVI-1)^2 + Albedo^2} \\]\n\n\n\nLarger DRI means more degraded soil and higher desertification risk\n\n\nIt is worth noting that this methodology has shown high accuracy in detecting and classifying desertification only in the Naiman Banner in Inner Mongolia (China) and not specifically in the Southern Sahel where Niger is located.
