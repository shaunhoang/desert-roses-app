Do not edit any of the headings.\n\n\nWhat is the problem you’re trying to address using this application?\nNiger, a landlocked country in Africa’s Sahel region, faces rising temperatures and low rainfall, indicative of desertification. The shrinking arable land and water sources pose food and water security threats, risking humanitarian crises and conflicts. Initiatives like Action Against Desertification (FAO-UN) and regional projects (FLEUVE, BRICKS) aim to restore degraded land. The flagship project “Great Green Wall,” spanning 15km wide and 8000km long, targets 100 million hectares of degraded land restoration, carbon sequestration, and green job creation by 2030. Despite all the initiatives and the work being done there is lack of centralized visibility on desertification risk to mobilise the GGW action plan with urgency and systematically across diverse actors. (110 words)\n\n\n\nWho are you building this application for? How does it address a need this community has?\nWe are building this application for the local government, NGOs and the people involved in GGW initiative so that if there is a centralized platform where they can visualize to what extent desertification effect Niger people at high spatial resolution and with another layer which will highlight specific areas within the GGW path that are most suitable for planting trees. (60 words)\n\n\n\nWhat data are you using?\nFor the purpose of land use land cover classification (LULC) and calculating vegetation and soil indices, we require Landsat 5, Landsat 7 ETM+, and Landsat 8 data. Additionally, for climate and rainfall data, we need MODIS Earth observation data.\nFurthermore, we need population density and distribution data, which we can obtain from WorldPop and Kontur.\nTo calculate slope from elevation data, we require Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data to generate a near-global digital elevation model (DEM) of the Earth using radar interferometry.\nMoreover, we will utilize GGW shapefiles, which can be directly drawn using QGIS. (95 words)\n\n\n\nHow are you using this data to address the problem?\n\n\n\nHow does your application’s interface work to address the needs of your end user?\n\n\n\n\nReplace the link below with the link to your application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this section to explain how your application works using code blocks and text explanations (no more than 500 words excluding code):\nMap.setCenter(35.51898, 33.90153, 15);\n\nMap.setOptions(\"satellite\");\n\nvar aoi = ee.Geometry.Point(35.51898, 33.90153).buffer(3000);\nYou can include images:\n\n\n\nPixelwise T-Test, 2018\n\n\nand math: \\[ \\Large t = {\\frac{\\overline{x_1}-\\overline{x_2}} {\\sqrt{\\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \\frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}}} \\]"
