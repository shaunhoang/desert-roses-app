# Identifying desertification risk areas in Niger and the Southern Sahel region

## Project Summary

### Problem Statement

Niger, a landlocked country in Africa’s Sahel region, faces rising temperatures, low rainfall and a decrease of arable land, indicative of desertification. The shrinking land and water sources pose food and water security threats, risking humanitarian crises and conflicts. Initiatives like Action Against Desertification (FAO-UN) and regional projects (FLEUVE, BRICKS) aim to restore degraded land and push back the desert. Most major initiatives in the fight against desertification converge on the flagship project “Great Green Wall,” spanning 15km wide and 8000km long, targeting 100 million hectares of degraded land restoration, carbon sequestration, and green job creation by 2030.

However, as each task force operates independently, there is a lack of centralized visibility on desertification risks in the nation to mobilise the GGW action plan with urgency and prioritise resources systematically across diverse actors.

### End User

This application is meant for the local government, NGOs and the different organisations involved in the Great Green Wall initiative so that there is a centralized platform where they can visualise to what extent desertification affects Niger people at high spatial resolution.

Future extensions of the tool include highlighting specific areas within the designated Great Green Wall path that are most suitable for planting trees and soil-enriching crops, making the insights more actionable for the implementing task forces and farmers nationwide.

### Data Source

To derive the *Desertification Index (*detailed methodology below), we will be using:

-   **Landsat 8 data** for hyperspectral remote sensing data

-   **MODIS data** for climate and rainfall data

Furthermore, we need population density data, which can obtained as rasters from WorldPop.

Finally, to delineate the boundaries of interest, we will utilize the following vector files:

-   **Great Green Wall designated area**, traced according to the Niger government's Action Plan.

-   **Niger Administrative Boundaries,** Level 0 through 4 from GADM

### Methodology

According to Wu et al. (2019), the Desertification Index is calculated using Landsat 8 and MODIS remote sensing data within the feature space of Albedo and Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI). More specifically, the Desertification Monitoring Index (DMI) is defined as:

$$ \Large DMI = L_2 = \frac{|{Albedo - \alpha MSAVI - \beta|}}{\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}} $$

![](images/clipboard-736368115.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

The larger $L_2$ , the more degraded the soil is. The distance $L_2$ represents the distance of the tassel from the soil line $L$ , derived from the respective indices are calculated as follows:

$$ Albedo = 0.356B_{blue} + 0.13B_{red} + 0.373B_{nir} + 0.085B_{swir1} + 0.072B_{swir2} - 0.0018 $$ 

$$ MSAVI = \frac{2B_{nir} + 1 - \sqrt{(2B_{nir} + 1)^2 - 8(B_{nir}-B_{red})}}2 $$ 

Lastly, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the parameters of the regression equation for the soil line $L$ in the feature space.

$$ Albedo = \alpha MSAVI + \beta  $$ 

It is worth noting that this methodology has shown high accuracy in detecting and classifying desertification only in the Naiman Banner in Inner Mongolia (China) and not specifically in the Southern Sahel where Niger is located. However, due to the lack of ground truth data for the time being and the fact that the two areas share similar characteristics in terms of wetness and vegetation, we see the application of this methodology as appropriate.

### Interface

First, the user picks the *year of interest* and a *year of comparison* in the past using a slider. This will produce two following layers:

-   Desertification risk areas are shaded in 3 different levels of severity

-   Areas that are newly desertified are shaded by the magnitude of change over the preset time range.

To acquire statistics on the extent of human impact, the user not only can either choose a province of interest from the drop-down menu but they can also draw the area of interest using the tool provided. The statistics shown are population living in desertifying and desertified areas, also broken down by age range and gender

## How it Works

Use this section to explain how your application works using code blocks and text explanations (no more than 500 words excluding code):

``` js
Map.setCenter(35.51898, 33.90153, 15);

Map.setOptions("satellite");

var aoi = ee.Geometry.Point(35.51898, 33.90153).buffer(3000);
```

You can include images:

and math: $$ \Large t = {\frac{\overline{x_1}-\overline{x_2}} {\sqrt{\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}}} $$
