The shrinking land and water sources pose food and water security threats, risking humanitarian crises and conflicts. Initiatives like Action Against Desertification (FAO-UN) and regional projects (FLEUVE, BRICKS) aim to restore degraded land and push back the desert.\n\nHowever, as each task force operates independently, the nation lacks centralised visibility on desertification risks to mobilise the GGW action plan with urgency and prioritise resources systematically across diverse actors.\n\n### End User\n\nThis application is meant for the local government, NGOs and the different organisations involved in the Great Green Wall initiative so that there is a centralised platform where they can visualise to what extent desertification affects Niger people at high spatial resolution.\n\nFuture extensions of the tool include highlighting specific areas within the designated Great Green Wall path that are most suitable for planting trees and soil-enriching crops, making the insights more actionable for the implementing task forces and farmers nationwide.\n\n### Data Source\n\nTo derive the *Desertification Index (*detailed methodology below), we used *Landsat 8 OLI data (2013-present)* for hyperspectral remote sensing data containing all the necessary spectral bands. Furthermore, to quantify the affected population, we used the *WorldPop global population raster data at 100m resolution (2000-2020*). Finally, to delineate the boundaries of interest, we will use *Niger Administrative Boundaries, Level 0 through 2.*\n\n### Methodology\n\nAccording to Wu et al. (2019), the Desertification Risk Index (DRI), which we have extracted from their Desert Matter Index (DMI), can be calculated using Landsat-8 remote sensing data, from which Albedo and Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) were calculated. Furthermore, Yang et al (2022) identify that the combined albedo-MSAVI formula is most optimal for identifying desertification in the Sahel region.\n\n#### Albedo\n\nAlbedo is a measure of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface, ranging from 0 (no reflectivity) to 1 (total reflectivity). It helps in understanding the Earth's energy balance as it indicates how much solar radiation is absorbed versus reflected back into space (Yale, n.d.). The formula for albedo, particularly using Landsat data (as the calculation can vary based on sensor and land type), involves a weighted combination of spectral bands B2 (Blue), B4 (Red), B5 (NIR), B6 (SWIR1), B7 (SWIR2); these represent different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum (Wu et al., 2019):\n\n$$ Albedo = 0.356B_{blue} + 0.13B_{red} + 0.373B_{nir} + 0.085B_{swir1} + 0.072B_{swir2} - 0.0018 $$\n\nHigh albedo values correlate with highly reflective surfaces (such as flat desert or snow terrains); low values correlate with poorly reflecting surfaces (such as dense forestation).\n\n| [Higher albedo]{.underline}, in this context, indicates [higher levels of desertification]{.underline}.\n\n#### Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index\n\nThe MSAVI is designed to minimise the impact of soil brightness when vegetation is sparse, providing a more accurate vegetation signal. This index is particularly useful in semi-arid regions, such as Niger, where exposed soil can significantly affect the standard vegetation indices like NDVI. It ranges from -1 (non-vegetated areas or sparse vegetation) to 1 (higher levels of vegetation and vegetation health). The formula for MSAVI is:\n\n$$ MSAVI = \\frac{2B_{nir} + 1 - \\sqrt{(2B_{nir} + 1)^2 - 8(B_{nir}-B_{red})}}2 $$\n\nThis index uses a quadratic function to reduce the influence of soil background by adjusting the red (B3) and near-infrared (B4) band values. The incorporation of an \"inductive L function\" in this formula helps to maximise the reduction of soil effects, enhancing the robustness of vegetation monitoring (USGS: Landsat Missions, n.d.; Wu et al., 2019).\n\nWe then adapt this by adding 1 to the value and dividing by 2 -- this shifts values to the 0 to 2 range and then standardises to them to the 0 to 1 range (same as albedo).\n\n| [Higher MSAVI]{.underline}, in this context, indicates [lower levels of desertification]{.underline}.\n\n#### Desertification Risk Index (DRI)\n\nThe DRI integrates the albedo and MSAVI to assess areas at risk of desertification (adapted from Wu et al., 2019; and Yang et al., 2022). Its composite score effectively synthesises information on both vegetation health and surface reflectivity into a single metric. Due to the opposite direction of each indicator correlating with higher levels of desertification, they need to be transformed so that they are in the same direction, before being weighed and aggregated. As such the formula for DRI is:\n\n$$ DRI = L_1 = \\sqrt{(MSAVI-1)^2 + Albedo^2} $$\n\nThis formula produces values where a higher DRI indicates greater risk of desertification. The use of Euclidean distance in this formula combines the deviations of MSAVI and albedo from their norms, providing a measure that is sensitive to changes in both vegetation cover and surface reflectivity.\n\n![A larger DRI means more degraded soil and higher desertification risk.](images/clipboard-449413320.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nIt is worth noting that this methodology has shown relatively high accuracy in detecting and classifying desertification in the Naiman Banner in Inner Mongolia (China) but not specifically in the Southern Sahel where Niger is located. However, thanks to the fact that the two areas share similar characteristics in terms of wetness and vegetation, we see the application of this methodology as appropriate for the Southern Sahel region.\n\n### Interface\n\nFirst, the user picks the *year of interest* using a slider. This will produce populated areas with high desertification risks.
